There project template is contained in a zip file.
The fzip is in the Project Templates subfolder.
The Rezip-Extension.bat batch script is used to update it.
This script is automatically triggered on every build
via a Pre-Build script.

To stop this:
1) Right-click the project, select Properties
2) Click the Build Events tab
3) Change this line
@set rebuildzip=1
   to
@set rebuildzip=

That will stop the batch file from being called, but
you must remember to invoke it manually to update the
zip with any changes.

Restore the line to
@set rebuildzip=1
to resume rebuilding the zip on every build.
